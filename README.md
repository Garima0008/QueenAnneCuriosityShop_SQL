# QueenAnneCuriosityShop_SQL

The Queen Anne Curiosity Shop sells both antiques and current-production household items that complement or are useful with the antiques. For example, the store sells antique 
dining room tables and new tablecloths. The antiques are purchased from both individuals and wholesalers, and the new items are purchased from distributors. The storeâ€™s customers 
include individuals, owners of bed-and-breakfast operations, and local interior designers who work with both individuals and small businesses. The antiques are unique, although 
some multiple items, such as dining room chairs, may be available as a set (sets are never broken). The new items are not unique, and an item may be reordered if it is out of stock. 
New items are also available in various sizes and colors (for example, a particular style of tablecloth may be available in several sizes and in a variety of colors).
